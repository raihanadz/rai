# Who are you ?

<span style="font-size: x-large; "> Hello dear Padawan :wave: </span>

<span style="font-size: x-large; "> You're learning `GIT` and want to make your first pull request in a repository other than yours ? </span>

<span style="font-size: x-large; "> You're at the right place :fire: ! What about create a pull request with a file that contains some information about you and a link to your repository ? </span>

## How To Contribute :computer:

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and sign in
2. For this repository (click on the “Fork” button)
3. After the “forking action” has completed, clone your fork locally (this will create a who-are-you directory):
`git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/who-are-you.git`
4. Go into who-are-you directory: `cd directory`
5. Create a branch (google is your friend)
6. Create a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) file inside the "src" directory with the content. :bulb: Use "md" as the extension of the filename, example: my_username.md
7. Commit your change (google is your friend)
8. Create the pull request via the github interface :tada:
9. Wait the review...
